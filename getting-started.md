## Download the Server

Retrieve the [server.jar][server-jar].

```sh
curl https://oss.treode.com/jars/{{site.vers}}/server-{{site.vers}}.jar -o server.jar
```

Throughout the discussions, we&#700;ll create database files. To keep it tidy, you may want to make a temporary directory and move the jar there. Then proceed to the [first walk through][rws].
